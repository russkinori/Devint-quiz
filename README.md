# Devint-quiz

## Description

This repo contains a typical coding assessment made up of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

It was created as a way to become familiar with these tests by applying the skills developed from completing the Javascript module.  The intention was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

The topics covered include javascript, html, css, queryselector, innerhtml, interval and web api.
